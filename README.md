  In this program we made four classes

•	Bill report
•	Add or remove or edit item
•	Show item details

In this process first of all we have to add the item. After we select add item, we have four options the first one is add item details. The second one is edit item details .the third one is delete the item details and the fourth one goes back to the main menu.

 After adding the item, selecting the item, we will go on the third class which is show item detail
